RAW DATA EXPLORATION

SAMPLING FREQUENCY
The effective sampling frequency is approximately 30 Hz for both accelerometer and gyroscope signals during sitting and walking, and slightly lower during stair climbing.

Sitting
	Accelerometer: ~30.8 Hz
	Gyroscope: ~29.6 Hz

Walking (phone in pocket)
	Accelerometer: ~30.6 Hz
	Gyroscope: ~29.4 Hz

Stairs (phone in pocket)
	Accelerometer: ~27.7 Hz
	Gyroscope: ~27.1 Hz

Minor variations across activities and sensors are likely due to hardware limitations and operating system scheduling. These differences motivate resampling during preprocessing to ensure consistent temporal alignment.

ACCELEROMETER SIGNALS
Sitting (phone on table)
	Raw tri-axial accelerometer signals exhibit very low variance and remain mostly flat over time, indicating 	minimal motion.
	A brief spike is observed at the beginning of the recording, likely caused by user interaction when 	starting the measurement.

Walking (phone in pocket)
	Acceleration magnitude shows continuous motion with moderate, regularly spaced peaks, reflecting periodic 	gait patterns.
	The signal exhibits higher variability than sitting, while maintaining a degree of regularity typical of 	steady walking.
	A large spike near the end of the recording corresponds to stopping or removing the phone from the pocket.

Stair climbing (phone in pocket)
	Acceleration magnitude displays higher peaks, greater variability, and less regular patterns compared to 	walking.
	These characteristics indicate stronger impacts and more intense motion associated with ascending and 	descending stairs.

GYROSCOPE SIGNALS
Sitting (phone on table)
	Gyroscope magnitude remains close to zero with very low variance, confirming minimal rotational motion 	when the device is stationary.

Walking (phone in pocket)
	Gyroscope magnitude increases significantly compared to sitting, showing continuous angular motion caused 	by leg and body rotation during gait.
	The signal is moderately variable and relatively regular, consistent with repetitive walking movements.

Stair climbing (phone in pocket)
	Gyroscope magnitude exhibits higher peaks and increased variability compared to walking.
	This reflects stronger and less regular rotational movements of the body while climbing stairs.

MOTION INTENSITY COMPARISON
Analysis of raw tri-axial signals and magnitude-based representations (accelerometer and gyroscope) reveals a clear progression of motion intensity:

Lowest intensity: Sitting (phone on table)

Moderate intensity: Walking (phone in pocket)

Highest intensity: Stair climbing (phone in pocket)

Both linear acceleration and angular velocity increase consistently from sitting to walking and reach maximum intensity during stair climbing. These results confirm that IMU signals effectively capture activity-dependent motion characteristics, even when the device is carried in a pocket.

NOTES

Both accelerometer and gyroscope data were analyzed to capture complementary aspects of motion:

Accelerometer → linear motion and impacts

Gyroscope → rotational motion

To reduce sensitivity to device orientation and simplify comparison across activities, signal magnitude was computed as the Euclidean norm of the tri-axial components:

Acceleration magnitude

Angular velocity (gyroscope) magnitude

Differences in device placement (table vs pocket) are explicitly accounted for when interpreting results.


Even during sitting, the accelerometer Z-axis does not converge to zero because the device is stationary but not in free fall; the sensor measures the gravitational acceleration component acting along the vertical axis, resulting in a non-zero offset.
The accelerometer measures specific force (force per unit mass), not kinematic acceleration.
When the device is supported by a surface, it measures the reaction force caused by gravity; in free fall, this force disappears and the measured acceleration approaches zero.
